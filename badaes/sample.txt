before and after. we have not yet grasped the results which the
reason alone can attain to. problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
aid of their senses. to carry the art, however, to its highest
pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. it is not so
impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this i have
endeavoured in my case to do. if i remember rightly, you on one
occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
in a very precise fashion."
"yes," i answered, laughing. "it was a singular document.
philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, i
remember. botany variable, geology profound as regards the
mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry
eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime
records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and
self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. those, i think, were the
main points of my analysis."
holmes grinned at the last item. "well," he said, "i say now, as
i said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic
stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the
rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
can get it if he wants it. now, for such a case as the one which
has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
all our resources. kindly hand me down the letter k of the
'american encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
thank you. now let us consider the situation and see what may be
deduced from it. in the first place, we may start with a strong
presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for
leaving america. men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for
the lonely life of an english provincial town. his extreme love
of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of
someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis
that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
america. as to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by
considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
and his successors. did you remark the postmarks of those
letters?"
"the first was from pondicherry, the second from dundee, and the
third from london."
"from east london. what do you deduce from that?"
"they are all seaports. that the writer was on board of a ship."
"excellent. we have already a clue. there can be no doubt that
the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
on board of a ship. and now let us consider another point. in the
case of pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
its fulfilment, in dundee it was only some three or four days.
does that suggest anything?"
"a greater distance to travel."
"but the letter had also a greater distance to come."
"then i do not see the point."
"there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
or men are is a sailing-ship. it looks as if they always send
their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
their mission. you see how quickly the deed followed the sign
when it came from dundee. if they had come from pondicherry in a
steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
but, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. i think that those
seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
writer."
"it is possible."
"more than that. it is probable. and now you see the deadly
urgency of this new case, and why i urged young openshaw to
caution. the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
it would take the senders to travel the distance. but this one
comes from london, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
"good god!" i cried. "what can it mean, this relentless
persecution?"
"the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital
importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. i think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
as to deceive a coroner's jury. there must have been several in
it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
in this way you see k. k. k. ceases to be the initials of an
individual and becomes the badge of a society."
"but of what society?"
"have you never--" said sherlock holmes, bending forward and
sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the ku klux klan?"
"i never have."
holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "here it
is," said he presently:
"'ku klux klan. a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
the sound produced by cocking a rifle. this terrible secret
society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the
southern states after the civil war, and it rapidly formed local
branches in different parts of the country, notably in tennessee,
louisiana, the carolinas, georgia, and florida. its power was
used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
of those who were opposed to its views. its outrages were usually
preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
